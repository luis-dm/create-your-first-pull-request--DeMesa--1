# Exercise 0: Git (Creating my first Pull Request)

## Details

In this exercise, I pushed a txt file containing my expectations for my CMSC 100 in the repository. Moreover, I acted on the roles of both the "creator" and "reviewer" in the exercise.

As a creator, I:

1. Cloned my partner's repository
2. Created a new branch on their repository and edited their expectations.txt
3. Committed my changed on my partner's repository
4. Pushed my changed on my partner's repository

As a reviewer, I:

1. Approved the changes made by my partner to my original repository, by:
   - visiting my repository
   - selecting "New Pull Request" from the menu
   - choosing the base repository and branch
   - comparing my partner's branch to be my branch
   - giving the pull request a title and description, and
   - selecting "Create Pull Request" from the menu
2. Examined the pull request and provided comments and approvals
3. Integrated the pull request into the basic repository
